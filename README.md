🚁 Autonomous & Manual QuadCopter Project
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to demonstrate, through a physical prototype, the feasibility of a quadcopter drone operating in two modes:
✅ Manual Mode – Controlled by a pilot.
✅ Autonomous Mode – Executes a predefined flight sequence without pilot intervention.

Since this is a demonstrator, flexibility is allowed in the choice of development platforms. The primary objective is to validate system functionality, rather than develop a commercial product.

✈️ Flight Sequence
The predefined flight sequence consists of:
1️⃣ Vertical Takeoff
2️⃣ Horizontal Flight (adjustable distance: 0 to 15m)
3️⃣ Vertical Landing

🔹 Altitude: 1.50m ± 50cm
🔹 Path: 4 predefined checkpoints

🎯 Key Objectives
🔹 Safety First – The manual override must be possible at any moment during autonomous flight.
🔹 Smooth Takeoff & Landing – The drone must gradually take off and land gently.
🔹 Stable Manual Control – It should be easy to fly manually.
🔹 Clear Mode Indicator – A visible light signal must indicate when autonomous mode is active.
🔹 Wind Sensitivity Analysis – The drone's stability and drift due to wind should be evaluated.

🔧 Technical Requirements
📌 The drone must be an electric quadcopter.
📌 It must be built using:

A commercial quadcopter base capable of manual flight.
Additional components (sensors, onboard computer, etc.) for autonomous operation.
📌 The autopilot must control the flight controller in the same way as a human operator using a remote control.
📌 Arming the drone is only possible in manual mode.
📌 The drone must fit within a 50cm × 50cm × 50cm cube.
